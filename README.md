JS Lodash Exercises
=
These exercises will help you to practice and discover some of the most useful functions Lodash provides.

To solve them, please refer to the formal [Lodash documentation](https://lodash.com/) and take a look at the files in the starter code in this repository.

## The Office

You work in a taxes office. Boring, right? And suddenly you discover you can use your extra time to learn how to code. An email arrives. Your bosses are sending a satisfaction survey. You decide to model the satisfaction of your coworkers.

- As you have five departments with 10 people working in each department, create a 5x10 array and fill it randomly with numbers from 1 to 20 to model the satisfaction survey results.

:bulb: **Hint:** Look at the Lodash Array methods. Use `_.times` if you need to repeat an action.

```javascript=
var employeeSatisfaction = function () {
  
  return array;
};
```

## Harry Potter's Birthdays

Navigating through Internet, we found a very messy array with the birthdays of Harry Potter's friends and enemies.

Take a look at the `harryPotter.js` array. It is so messy, they can't even remember which date belongs to whom. But we know each date follows each character's name. Turn this array into arrays of pairs.

Some of the birthdays are missing. But we found another array with birthdays from the book. Add these birthdays to the array you had before.
```javascript
var moreBirthdays = ["Lily Evans", "30 January", "James Potter", "27 March",
                     "Dudley Dursley", "30 June", "Tom Riddle", "31 December"];
```

## The Password Problem

Yeah, yeah, to set a password is ALWAYS a big trauma. We will ask for a password to our users and we need to implement validation methods for this password.

**Different characters:** create a function that receives a password and returns an error if every char in the password is not unique.

:::success
:bulb: **Hint:** Look at the Lodash Array methods. Use `_.times` if you need to repeat an action.

```javascript=
var goodPsswd = "1234567890";
var badPsswd = "1123456";
var noRepeatChar = function (password) {
 //your code goes here
};

noRepeatChar(goodPsswd);
noRepeatChar(badPsswd);
```
**Only numbers:** Create a function that receives a password and returns an error if the password has any character different than numbers.


```javascript=
var goodPsswd = "1234567890";
var badPsswd = "1a234567890";
var onlyNumbers = function () {
 //your code goes here
}
onlyNumbers(goodPsswd);
onlyNumbers(badPsswd);
```

**Ten digits only:** Create a function that trim the password and turns it into a 10 digits password. The function should keep the first 10 digits and discard the rest of them.

```javascript=
var goodPsswd = "1234567890";
var badPsswd = "12345678901234567890";
var trimPassword = function (password) {
 //your code goes here
}
trimPassword(badPsswd);
```

## Abbey Road Studios

Abbey Road Studios opened in 1931. Through all these years, the amount of data they've been collecting is huge. We found a [list of recordings made at Abbey Road Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recordings_made_at_Abbey_Road_Studios) but we are not sure if it is actually an important place for music or if its fame is just a result of the hype created by The Beatles.

Lodash is a great tool for retrieving information. But first, take a look at the data object located in the `abbeyRoad.js` file in your `lib` folder.

**November looks like a good month:** In the 30's, they use to gather information about the months when the recordings where made. Get the artist who recorded the most on November in Abbey Road.

```javascript=
var novemberArtists = function () {
  //your code
};
//Remember to execute the function to actually assing the value to the var.
```

**Artists like to repeat:** Get the artist who recorded the most times in Abbey Road.

```javascript=
var bestArtist = function () {
  //your code
};
//Remember to execute the function to actually assing the value to the var.
```

**EXTRA: The Beatles and Abbey Road:** When did the four of Liverpool recorded their last song in Abbey Road Studios?

## Summary

Lodash could help you, specially when starting to code, to think in a more functional manner. It is also a good tool to avoid repetition and speed up coding time. Through these exercises you got familiar with the Lodash documentation and some of the over a 100 functions it provides.
